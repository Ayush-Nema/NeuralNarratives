### FAQs
- Q: Did prompt engineering existed before LLMs?
	- A: Yes. Before the inception of LLMs, the PE was known as Search result optimization. We all have used Google search in which we can frame our search so as to get better results
		- use of symbols and characters for better search query
		- little nudge in search query can completely change the search results. This is especially valid for weaker search engines like Duckduckgo, older bing etc.

- Q: What it takes to learn PE?
	- A: Various components can into PE like:
		- capabilities of system (model) in and out means -
			- what kind of results the system can produce
			- what kind of output format that it can produce
		- what kind of knowledge (subject matter boundaries) does the model has
		- what kind of questions or language components can it understand
	- Ex: 
		- asking ChatGPT for a workflow of MLOps. (it will not cater the requirements as it is only language model. It will say: I am language trained model and I can only produce text-based results)
		- asking ChatGPT questions regarding recent events. (won't do as it is trained on data uptil 2021).
