# Introduction
- explore the benefits of using GPT-4 and ChatGPT, focusing on their ability to maintain context in conversations. 
- demonstrate how these advanced language models can remember conversation history and respond accordingly, making them ideal for chat applications. 
- discuss the improvements in GPT-4, such as longer context length and better generalization. 
- understand how GPT-4 and ChatGPT can be used for context-aware chat applications via the API, as opposed to just using the OpenAI ChatGPT webpage.

**ChatGPT vs GPT-4**
- GPT-4's short-term memory capacity of 64,000 words greatly surpasses GPT-3.5's 8,000-word limit, enabling it to maintain context more effectively in prolonged conversations. 
- GPT-4 is highly multilingual, accurately handling up to 26 languages, and boasts improved steering capabilities, allowing users to tailor responses with a custom "personality."
- The new model is considerably safer to use, boasting a 40% increase in factual responses and an 82% reduction in disallowed content responses. 
- It can also interpret images as a foundation for interaction. While this functionality has not yet been incorporated into ChatGPT, its potential to revolutionize context-aware chat applications is immense.

# Setting up the API
The following example demonstrates how to create a chatbot using the GPT-4 model from OpenAI. It starts by setting the context for the model (`SystemMessage`) that it is an assistant, followed by the user’s query (`HumanMessage`), and finishes by defining a sample response from the AI model (`AIMessage`).
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    HumanMessage(content="What is the capital of France?"),
    AIMessage(content="The capital of France is Paris.")
]
```

When the user posed the question about the capital of France, the model confidently answered with "Paris.” Next up, we test if the model can leverage these discussions as a reference to delve further into details about the city without us explicitly mentioning the name (referring to Paris). The code below adds a new message which requires the model to understand and find the “city you just mentioned” reference from previous conversations.


```python
prompt = HumanMessage(
    content="I'd like to know more about the city you just mentioned."
)
# add to messages
messages.append(prompt)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4")

response = llm(messages)
```

Output
```python
AIMessage(content='Paris, the capital of France, is one of the most famous and visited cities in the world. It is located in the north-central part of the country, along the Seine River. With a population of over 2 million people, it is a bustling metropolis known for its art, culture, history, and gastronomy.\n\nParis is often referred to as the "City of Light" (La Ville Lumière) due to its role in the Age of Enlightenment and its early adoption of street lighting. The city is home to numerous iconic landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Arc de Triomphe. \n\nParis is also known for its charming neighborhoods, such as Montmartre, Le Marais, and Saint-Germain-des-Prés, each with its own unique character and attractions. The city has an extensive public transportation system, including buses, trams, and the Métro, making it easy to explore its various districts.\n\nAs a global center for art, fashion, and culture, Paris hosts numerous events and exhibitions throughout the year, such as Paris Fashion Week and the Paris Air Show. The city is also renowned for its culinary scene, featuring a wide array of restaurants, cafés, patisseries, and food markets that offer both traditional French cuisine and international flavors.\n\nIn addition to its historical and cultural attractions, Paris is an important international business hub and the headquarters for many multinational corporations and organizations, including UNESCO, the OECD, and the International Chamber of Commerce.', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)
```

The model successfully extracted the information from previous conversations and explained more details about Paris. It shows that the chat models are capable of referring to the chat history and understanding the context.
