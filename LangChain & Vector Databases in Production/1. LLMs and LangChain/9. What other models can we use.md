# Introduction
- This lesson will delve into integrating several LLM models in LangChain. 
- Examine the platforms supporting these LLM models and compare their features. 
- LangChain has built-in support for some of the most popular publicly available pre-trained models.

- LangChain provides close to 30 integrations with well-known AI platforms like OpenAI, Cohere, Writer, and Replicate, to name a few. 
- Most notably, they provide access to Huggingface Hub API with more than 120K available models that can be easily incorporated into your applications. 

- It is a common practice to pay for the API interfaces. The prices are usually determined by factors such as the number of processed tokens, as seen in OpenAI, or the process’s duration measured in hours of GPU usage, as is the case with Huggingface Interface or Amazon Sagemaker. However, it is worth noting that you do not own the models, even if it was fine-tuned on your valuable datasets. They just provide access to the API with a pay-as-you-go plan.
	- On the other side of the spectrum, hosting the models locally on your servers is possible. It will enable you to have full and exclusive control over the network and your dataset. It is important to be aware of the hardware (high-end GPU for low latency) and maintenance (the expertise to deploy and fine-tune models) costs that are associated with this approach. 


The different models’ characteristics are another consideration. The network sizes and the dataset quality directly impact its language understanding capability. In contrast, a larger model is not always the best answer. The GPT-3’s Ada variation is the smallest model in the collection, making it the fastest and most cost-effective option with low latency. However, it suits more straightforward tasks like parsing text or classification. Conversely, the latest GPT-4 version is the largest model to generate high-quality results for every task. But, the large number of parameters makes it a slow and the most expensive option. It might be cheaper to use Ada to implement an application to hold a conversation, but it is not the model’s objective and will result in disappointing responses. (You can read [this article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-benchmark-language-models-by-openai-deepmind-google-microsoft-783d4307ec50) for a comparison between a number of well-known LLMs)


# Popular LLM models accessible to LangChain via API
## Cohere command
The Cohere service provides a variety of models such as _Command_ (`command`) for dialogue-like interactions, _Generation_ (`base`) for generative tasks, _Summarize_ (`summarize-xlarge`) for generating summaries, [and more](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models). You can get free, rate-limited usage for learning and prototyping. This means that usage is free until you go into production, however some of the models may be a bit more expensive than OpenAI APIs when you do—for example, $2.5 for generating 1K tokens. However, since Cohere offers more customized models for each task, this could lead to a more use case-specific model having improved outcomes in downstream tasks. The LangChain’s Cohere class makes it easy to access these models. `Cohere(model="<MODEL_NAME>", cohere_api_key="<API_KEY>")`

```ad-warning
You might see deprecated model names in the LangChain documentation. (like `command-xlarge-20221108`) Please refer to the Cohere [documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models) for the latest naming convention.
```

## GPT-3.5
GPT-3.5 is a language model developed by OpenAI. Its turbo version (recommended by OpenAI over [other variants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)) offers a more affordable option for generating human-like text through an API accessible via OpenAI endpoints. The model is optimized for chat applications while remaining powerful on other generative tasks and can process 96 languages. GPT-3.5-turbo has a up to 16K tokens context length and is the most cost-effective option from the OpenAI collection with only $0.002 per 1000 tokens. It is possible to access this model’s API by using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` key while initializing either `ChatOpenAI` or `OpenAI` classes.

## GPT-4
OpenAI's GPT-4 is a competent multimodal model with an undisclosed number of parameters or training procedures. It is the latest and most powerful model published by OpenAI, and the multi-modality enables the model to process both text and image as input. The two variants of the model are `gpt-4` and `gpt-4-32k` with different context lengths, 8192 and 32768 tokens, respectively.

## Jurassic-2
The AI21’s Jurassic-2 is a LM with three sizes and different price points: Jumbo, Grande, and Large. The model sizes are not publicly available, but their documentation marks the Jumbo version as the most powerful model. They describe the models as general-purpose with excellent capability on every generative task. Their J2 model understands seven languages and can be fine-tuned on custom datasets. Getting your API key from the AI21 platform and using the `AI21()`class to access these models is possible.

## StableLM
StableLM Alpha is a LM developed by Stable Diffusion, which can be accessed via HuggingFace Hub (with the following id `stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-3b`) to host locally or Replicate API with a rate from $0.0002 to $0.0023 per second. So far, it comes in two sizes, 3 billion and 7 billion parameters. The weights for StableLM Alpha are available under CC BY-SA 4.0 license with commercial use access. The context length of StableLM is 4096 tokens.

## Dolly-v2-12B
Dolly-v2-12B is a LM created by Databricks, which can be accessed via HuggingFace Hub (with the following id `databricks/dolly-v2-3b`) to host locally or Replicate API with the same price range as mentioned in the previous subsection. It has 12 billion parameters and is available under an open source license for commercial use. The base model used for Dolly-v2-12B is Pythia-12B.

## GPT4ALL
GPT4ALL is based on meta’s LLaMA model with 7B parameters. It is a LM developed by Nomic-AI that can be accessed through GPT4ALL and Hugging Face Local Pipelines. The model is published with a GPL 3.0 open-source license. However, it is not free to use for commercial applications. It is available for researchers to use for their projects and experiments. We went through this model’s capability and usage process in the previous lesson.

## [OpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/openai.html)
OpenAI platform is one of the biggest companies focusing on LLMs. By introducing their conversational model, ChatGPT, they were the first service to catch mainstream media attention on the potency of LLMs. They also provide a large variety of API endpoints for different NLP tasks with different price points. The LangChain library provides multiple classes for convenient access, examples of which we saw in previous lessons, like `ChatGPT` and `GPT4` classes.

The platform hosts over 120k models and 20k datasets. They offer the Spaces service for researchers and developers to create a demo and showcase their model’s capabilities quickly. The platform hosts large-scale models such as StableLM by Stability AI, Dolly by DataBricks, or Camel by Writer. The `HuggingFaceHub` class takes care of downloading and initializing the models.

This integration provides access to many models that are optimized for Intel CPUs using [Intel® Extension for PyTorch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch) library. The mentioned package can be applied to models with minimal code change. It enables the networks to take advantage of Intel**®**’s advanced architectural designs to significantly enhance CPU and GPU lines' performance. For example, the reports reveal a 3.8 speed up while running the BLOOMZ model (text-to-image) on the Intel® Xeon® 4s CPU compared to the previous generation with no changes in architecture/weights. When the mentioned optimization library was used alongside the 4th generation of Intel® Xeon® CPU, the inference speed rate increased nearly twofold to 6.5 times its original value. ([online demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Intel/Stable-Diffusion-Side-by-Side)) [Whisper](https://huggingface.co/Intel/whisper-large-int8-dynamic) and [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/Intel/gpt-j-6B-int8-dynamic) are two other examples of widely recognized models that leverage these efficiency gains.
